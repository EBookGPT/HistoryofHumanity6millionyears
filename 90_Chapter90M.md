# Chapter 90: Marriage and Divorce

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of a forest, there lived a brilliant scientist named Dr. Franken. Dr. Franken had always been fascinated by the institution of marriage, and had spent years studying its history and evolution. Using his vast knowledge of biology, genetics, and psychology, he set out to create the perfect mate - a companion who would be capable of adapting to the changing needs of a rapidly evolving society.

One day, as Dr. Franken was deep in thought, he had an epiphany. He realized that the key to creating the perfect mate lay not in splicing together the best traits of various people, but in creating a system of marriage and divorce that would allow individuals to choose their own partners based on their own desires and needs. And so, he set out to create a new set of laws and customs that would revolutionize the way we think about marriage.

With the help of his assistant, a brilliant legal scholar named Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Dr. Franken researched and studied every aspect of marriage throughout history. They analyzed the role that gender, power, and social norms had played in shaping the institution, and the ways in which marriage had both empowered and oppressed individuals over the centuries.

Armed with this knowledge, Dr. Franken and Justice Ginsburg set about creating a new system of marriage and divorce. They proposed new laws that would promote equality between partners, and that would allow couples to dissolve their marriages in a fair and equitable manner.

At first, their ideas were met with fierce resistance from traditionalists, who viewed marriage and divorce as sacred institutions that should not be tampered with. But over time, their ideas caught on, and more and more people began to see the benefits of their new system.

Today, thanks to the tireless efforts of Dr. Franken and Justice Ginsburg, we have a system of marriage and divorce that is more fair and equitable than ever before. Couples are able to choose their own partners based on their own needs and desires, and can dissolve their marriages in a way that is fair to both parties.

As we reflect on the history of marriage and divorce, we are reminded of the power of knowledge and the importance of continuously striving for progress. Thanks to the work of Dr. Franken and Justice Ginsburg, we are one step closer to creating a society that is truly equal for all.
