# Chapter 74: Business and Finance - Dracula Story

The night was dark and stormy, as Count Dracula sat in his castle, brooding over his vast fortune. For centuries, he had been accumulating wealth through his dark powers, but he had grown tired of his endless hoarding. He longed to do something with his riches, to invest them in ways that would benefit mankind.

As Count Dracula pondered his dilemma, a figure appeared before him. It was a wise old man with a white beard, carrying a leather-bound book. The man introduced himself as a financial guru from the modern era, a certain Warren Buffett. Buffett had travelled through time to advise Dracula on how to properly invest his wealth.

Dracula was initially hesitant to trust Buffett, but the investor was persuasive. He told Dracula about the power of investing in promising companies with ethical practices, and the importance of diversification to protect against risk. Buffett also warned Dracula of the dangers of greed and short-term thinking, and the necessity of playing the long game.

Finally convinced, Dracula followed Buffett's advice and invested his wealth in various companies that aligned with ethical and sustainable practices. To his surprise, he found that his wealth grew faster than ever before, and that he was making a positive impact on the world.

As dawn broke over the horizon, Warren Buffett bade farewell to Dracula, reminding him that his newfound wealth could be used to make a positive difference in the world. Inspired by his newfound education about ethical investing, Dracula pledged to continue investing his wealth in companies aimed at creating positive change.
