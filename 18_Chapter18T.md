# Chapter 18: The Medieval Period

Sherlock Holmes and his trusted companion John Watson arrived in medieval Europe on a mission to solve a perplexing mystery. The year was 1252, and they found themselves in Rome, under the pontificate of Innocent IV.

"Mr Holmes," said Watson as they emerged from their carriage. "What brings us to Rome in this particular era?"

"My dear Watson," replied Holmes. "There's been a theft at the University of Paris, and the stolen item is believed to be in the possession of one of the scholars here in Rome."

With that, they set out on a mission to uncover the thief and retrieve the stolen goods. They began their investigation by interviewing the scholars at the university, one of whom was a young Thomas Aquinas.

As they spoke to him, Holmes noticed a strange glint in his eye and a fidgety demeanor. After careful observation, Holmes deduced that Aquinas was the thief.

Upon confronting him, Aquinas confessed that he had stolen a rare manuscript on theology from the University of Paris. "I was curious to study its contents," he said, "but I knew I couldn't keep it for long. That's why I hid it in Rome, hoping to return it one day."

Holmes convinced Aquinas to return the manuscript to its rightful owners in Paris and helped him avoid prosecution by using his influence with the Church.

"What a remarkable solution," Watson commented. "It's no wonder you are so highly regarded among academics, Mr Holmes."

As they left Rome, Holmes mused on the brilliant mind of Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the greatest theologians of his time. It was a satisfying conclusion to a case that had led them to the heart of medieval Europe, showcasing the intellectual prowess and moral complexity of a fascinating period in human history.
