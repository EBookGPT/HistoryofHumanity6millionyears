# Chapter 86: Disability and Ableism

In this chapter, we will explore the often-overlooked topic of disability and the discrimination faced by those with disabilities, also known as ableism. To help us better understand this important issue, we are fortunate to have a special guest, Temple Grandin, a world-renowned author, speaker, and advocate for people with autism.

As we delve into the history of humanity, we will discover that people with disabilities have been present in every society, yet they have often been stigmatized, marginalized, and excluded from mainstream activities. We will learn about the concept of "normalcy," which has been used to define social norms and exclude those who do not fit into them. We will also examine the history of medicalization and institutionalization of people with disabilities, which has led to their systematic exclusion from society.

However, we will also uncover stories of resilience and activism as people with disabilities have fought for their rights and dignity. From the Disability Rights Movement in the United States to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we will explore the milestones achieved in the struggle for disability rights.

Through our exploration of disability and ableism, we will better understand the social and political forces that shape our perceptions of difference and our treatment of those who do not conform to societal norms. We will learn about the importance of inclusion and accessibility, and how we can work towards a more just and equitable society where everyone can participate fully.

So let us embark on this journey into the complex and multifaceted world of disability and ableism, and learn from the insights and experiences of Temple Grandin and the many other advocates who have dedicated their lives to creating a more inclusive world for everyone.
# Chapter 86: Disability and Ableism - The Curse of Ableism

Count Dracula had always been fascinated with the idea of perfection. He believed that beauty and strength were the greatest virtues that humanity could possess. He had little patience for those who were different or did not fit his mold. In his mind, people with disabilities were weak and inferior, and therefore not worthy of his attention.

One day, Count Dracula heard about a young girl who was an amazing horse whisperer. Despite her diagnosis of autism, she had a unique talent for understanding the behavior of horses and could communicate with them in a way that no one else could. Curious about this fascinating girl, Dracula invited her to his castle to see her skills for himself.

Temple Grandin, the girl with autism, arrived at the castle with her mother. As she stepped inside, she immediately felt a strange and eerie presence. Dracula offered her a seat and began to ask questions about her talent. However, as he learned more about Temple and her diagnosis, he became impatient and dismissive. He wanted nothing to do with someone he considered as 'imperfect' and ordered his guards to remove Temple and her mother from his castle.

But as Temple left the castle, an unexpected event took place. Count Dracula suddenly became paralyzed, as if a powerful curse had been cast upon him. His guards were frightened and unable to move, and so they called upon the services of a renowned physician who specialized in the treatment of disabilities.

The physician was none other than Temple Grandin's mentor, who arrived at the castle and quickly diagnosed Count Dracula's condition. It was revealed that the curse of ableism had overtaken Count Dracula, as he had become paralyzed due to his inability to accept people with disabilities as equals.

The physician explained that disability is a natural part of the human condition and that everyone has different abilities that should be celebrated and respected. Through his own experience of working with people with autism, he showed Dracula how people with disabilities can make huge contributions to society if they are given the chance to do so.

As Count Dracula began to understand the error of his ways, he became remorseful and apologized to Temple and her mother. He realized that he had been ignorant and narrow-minded, and that people with disabilities were not inferior but just different. He pledged to be more inclusive and to support the rights and dignity of people with disabilities.

With the curse lifted and Count Dracula transformed, Temple and her mother bid farewell to the Count and his guards, who had now become her friends. As they left the castle, Temple reflected on the powerful lesson they had learned about the importance of inclusion and the danger of ableism. She smiled knowing that her unique talents had helped change Count Dracula's views and, in turn, contributed to a more accepting and just society.

And so, the Legend of the Curse of Ableism became a symbol of the struggles that people with disabilities have faced throughout history. Yet, it also became a story of hope and resilience, showing that everyone has the power to change and the potential to make the world a better place.
