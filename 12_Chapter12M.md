# Chapter 12: Mesopotamia - The Land Between Two Rivers

Nestled between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers lies the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia was a region in the eastern Mediterranean that includes modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, and parts of Syria, Iran, and Turkey. The fertile land between the two rivers allowed the growth of crops, which allowed for the development of farming and human settlements around 10,000 BCE.

Mesopotamia was home to many great civilizations, including the Sumerians, Babylonians, Akkadians, and Assyrians. These civilizations influenced the course of history with their innovations, inventions, and contributions to human society. 

And who better to guide us through this chapter than a special guest - Hammurabi, the sixth king of Babylon, who conquered many city-states and created one of the oldest legal codes in history. 

As we explore Mesopotamia and its many wonders, we will delve into the art, religion, government, and social structure of these great civilizations, and how they impacted the course of humanity's history, leading up to modern times. Join us on this journey through the land between two rivers.
# King Hammurabi and the Knights of the Round Table

King Arthur and his knights had heard tales of the great civilization that had arisen in Mesopotamia, a land that was known for its incredible advancements in science, agriculture, and government. Eager to learn more, the knights decided to travel to Mesopotamia to meet with a special guest - none other than Hammurabi, the sixth king of Babylon.

Upon arriving in Mesopotamia, the knights were amazed by the great ziggurats, towering temples, and bustling cities that lay before them. They were welcomed with open arms by Hammurabi and his people, who were eager to share their knowledge with the visiting knights.

Hammurabi led the knights on a grand tour of the magnificent city of Babylon, pointing out the great irrigation systems that provided water to crops and the grand palace where he held court. He showed them the incredible libraries filled with ancient texts, and they marveled at the intricate carvings and paintings that adorned the temples.

As they wandered the city, the knights could not help but be impressed by the intelligence and ingenuity of the Babylonians. They were amazed by Hammurabi's famous Code of Laws, which was displayed in the city square for all to see. His laws were fair and just, and he had taken great care to ensure that all citizens were treated equally.

In the end, the knights left Mesopotamia inspired by what they had seen and learned. They returned to Arthur's court eager to share the knowledge they had gained with their fellow knights and the people of their kingdom. And so, thanks to the wisdom and guidance of King Hammurabi, the Knights of the Round Table were forever changed by their journey to the land between two rivers.
