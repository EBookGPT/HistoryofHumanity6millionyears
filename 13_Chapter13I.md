# Chapter 13: Indus Valley Civilization

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson arrived in Mohenjo-daro, the city at the heart of the Indus Valley Civilization, to investigate a mystery that had puzzled archaeologists for years. They were standing at the entrance to a building, which was believed to be the granary of the city.

Holmes examined the structure closely, observing the unique construction and design of the granary. "This is like no other granary I have seen before, Watson," noted Holmes. "But what is the mystery that requires our attention?"

Mohenjo-daro, the special guest for this chapter, stepped forward to explain the mystery. "The granary was built to store grains, and was praised for being tightly sealed and conditioned," she said. "However, recently a strange fungus has been affecting the grains inside the granary, causing illness among the people who consume them. We have been unable to determine the cause of this fungus, and we fear it may have something to do with an unknown factor."

Holmes and Watson began to investigate the situation, examining the grains and the granary in detail. They discovered that the grain storage system in the granary was hugely advanced, with a ventilation system that regulated the temperature and humidity. They also found traces of copper in the bottom of the granary, which appeared to be a part of the storage system.

After careful examination, Holmes concluded that the fungus was caused by the copper containers, which were reacting with the grains, producing a poisonous chemical. The clever ventilation system had been bringing in the air from outside, causing the copper to oxidize and release the poisonous chemical into the grains.

Thanks to their brilliant investigation, Holmes and Watson solved the mystery of the deadly fungus in the granary. The Indus Valley Civilization was known for its advancements in engineering, urban planning, and knowledge of science. However, this case reminded us that even advanced civilizations can have weaknesses and unanticipated problems. The downfall of the Indus Valley Civilization remains a mystery that we continue to explore and learn from today.
