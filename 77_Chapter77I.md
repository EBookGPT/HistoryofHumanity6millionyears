*Special guest: Malala Yousafzai*

As our journey through the history of humanity continues, we now enter a time when countries began to realize that they need to work together for the greater good. This led to the formation of international organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which played a critical role in shaping the course of human history.

In this chapter, we will explore these organizations, their goals, and their impact on the world. We will also be joined by a special guest, Malala Yousafzai, who has been a tireless advocate for girls' education and a champion for human rights.

Together, we will learn about the United Nations, the World Health Organization, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, and many other organizations that have worked to improve the lives of people around the world.

Join us on this journey as we explore the fascinating story of international organizations and NGOs and the role they played in shaping the history of humanity over the past 6 million years.

*Special guest: Malala Yousafzai*

Count Dracula had always been fascinated by the workings of human society. Over the centuries, he had seen the rise and fall of countless empires, but there was one thing that always fascinated him - how humans managed to cooperate and build a better world despite their differences.

One night, as he was wandering through a remote village, Dracula came across a group of young girls. They were huddled together and whispering among themselves. As he approached, he overheard their conversation. They were discussing how their village lacked access to education and how their families struggled to meet their basic needs.

Dracula, moved by their plight, decided to take action. He called upon his contacts from around the world, including the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and Amnesty International, among others. Together, they helped to provide the village with access to education, clean water, and other basic necessities.

But their work was not yet done. Dracula and his allies noticed that there were other villages throughout the world that were suffering similar fates. They decided to form a non-governmental organization (NGO) to help people in need all around the world. Malala Yousafzai, with her passion for girls' education, was particularly instrumental in shaping the goals and values of the organization.

Dracula and his allies worked tirelessly, establishing partnerships with local organizations, lobbying governments and world leaders, and providing assistance to those who needed it most. Over time, their organization grew in size and influence, and they were able to make a meaningful impact on the lives of countless people around the world.

As dawn broke, and the villagers gathered to say goodbye to Dracula and his allies, they expressed their gratitude for the help they had received. The girls who had once whispered among themselves now laughed and played together, their futures bright and full of promise.

Dracula, Malala Yousafzai, and their allies looked out over the village, proud of the work they had done. Though they knew there would always be more work to do, they knew that they had made a difference, and that they had played a small part in building a better world for all of humanity - a world where everyone had the opportunity to thrive, and where the darkness of poverty and ignorance could be banished for good.
